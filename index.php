<!-- for 5/27: 
    how can we make it so that the sticky images stop sticking whenever we hit the final text?
    make it so that hovering over any of the images makes them opaque with text and clicking them sends you to another website
    make the colors and fonts prettier, as well as experiment with the border radius and the colors of the background and size of padding to create a really modern looking website
    finish the about me page, using this page as a template.  -->

            Hey, Iâ€™m Zack â€” welcome to my digital space.
            This site is part portfolio, part personal journal, and part invitation. I'm a student, software developer, and community advocate with a passion for using tech to solve problems that matter â€” whether thatâ€™s helping people connect more deeply, play more freely, or challenge injustice more boldly.

            Iâ€™m currently a freshman in college, but Iâ€™ve been building things â€” both in code and in community â€” for a while now. Some of those things look like games and apps; others look like systems of support, acts of resistance, and spaces for real conversations. I believe technology isnâ€™t just about what we build â€” itâ€™s also about why we build it, who we build it for, and how we show up along the way.

            In high school, I helped lead efforts to address racism, sexism, and homophobia between students and teachers. I worked directly with administrators to co-create anti-discrimination training, making space for student voices to influence real policy. That experience taught me that advocacy and innovation arenâ€™t separate paths â€” they feed each other. I bring that mindset into my code, my collaborations, and the way I move through the world.

            On the tech side, I love experimenting with emerging tools and interfaces. Iâ€™ve built a gesture-controlled video game using Googleâ€™s Mediapipe and OpenCV, where finger movements through space act as game input. That project came together in a 36-hour sprint with a team of four, and I took the lead on task delegation, implementation, and final presentation to a panel of judges. Iâ€™ve also worked on speech-to-text functionality for React Native apps using @react-native-voice/voice, and Iâ€™ve used MATLAB for epidemiological modeling to analyze COVID-19 trends in St. Louis during the Delta and Omicron phases. Whether itâ€™s mobile development, data analysis, or interactive media, Iâ€™m all about learning fast, building intentionally, and staying curious.

            Right now, Iâ€™m working toward personal growth on every level â€” physically (cutting down and leaning out while building strength), mentally (learning new languages, frameworks, and systems), and socially (connecting with people who care about tech, equity, and creativity). Iâ€™m also preparing for an upcoming trip to Tanzania, where I hope to learn and contribute in meaningful ways beyond the classroom or IDE.

            This site is a place to keep track of the journey â€” and to invite folks like you along for the ride.

            ðŸ‘‰ Check out my About Me page to learn more about my background, values, and goals.
            ðŸ‘‰ Explore my Past Projects to see what Iâ€™ve built and what Iâ€™m experimenting with now.

            Thanks for being here. If anything resonates, Iâ€™d love to connect â€” feel free to reach out.
